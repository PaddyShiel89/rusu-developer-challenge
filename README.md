<h1 align="center">RUSU Frontend Web Developer Challenge</h1>
As part of the interview for the Front End Web Developer role for RUSU, please complete the task prepared below. Please ensure we have received all required information at least 24 hours before your interview.

The aim of this challenge is for us to get an idea of your technical and creative ability using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1.	Clone or download the project files from the GitHub repository.
2.	Use the blank index page to create a page to showcase RUSU events. Keep the following in mind when creating the page:
* Events information does not need to be factual â€“ feel free to make up events if you wish.
* Ensure the page is accessible and responsive.
* The site does not need to follow RUSU branding, though you will find a copy of the branding guidelines in the docs folder.
* Dummy asset files have been added to the repository for you to use if you wish. You can also use images from stock image sites or search engines.
* Ensure key information is clearly displayed for events.
3.	Upload your page files to a new GitHub repository and send a link to the repo to marketing@rusu.co.uk.

The Bootstrap framework is included in the index file. You can use a mix of Bootstrap and your own code to build the page. Feel free to add NPM packages that aid development, such as SASS, however, please do not use any other styling or UI frameworks to create the page aside from Bootstrap. 

This task should take around 8 hours to complete.
