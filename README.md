<h1 align="center">RUSU Frontend Web Developer Challenge</h1>

1. Download the project files from the GitHub repository.
2.	Use the template to create a page to display and link to upcoming RUSU events.
    * Ensure the page is accessible and responsive.
    * The site does not need to follow RUSU branding, though you will find a copy of the branding guidelines in the GitHub files.
    * Dummy asset files have been added to the repository for you to use if you wish.
    * Ensure key information is clearly displayed for events.
3.	Upload your page files to a new GitHub repository and send a link to the repo to marketing@rusu.co.uk.

The Bootstrap framework is included in the index file. You can use a mix of Bootstrap and your own code to build the page.

This challenge should take around 8 hours to complete.
